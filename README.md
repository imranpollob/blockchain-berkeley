# Blockchain Resources

Motivation for this project: 
As a new learner of Blockchain, I found it challenging to gather a comprehensive and in-depth overview of the technology from the internet. The internet is full of data, but it's not organized enough to generate knowledge. That's why I am trying to create a complete resource guide to follow to master Blockchain.
