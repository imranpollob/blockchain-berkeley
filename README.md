## What is Bitcoin?

### Definitions

**Cryptocurrency:** A form of currency that’s stored completely digitally, and isn’t issued by a central authority. Made secure with cryptography, distributed consensus, and economic incentive alignment.
- Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency.

**Blockchain:** The data structure used to represent a cryptocurrency. Stores data in a way that allows multiple parties to access it reliably without having to trust one another.

### Key Characteristics of a Currency

- Durability: The currency does not lose value and is not destroyed or made irredeemable easily.
- Portability: The currency is easy to transport from place to place.
- Divisibility: The currency can be easily exchanged in different denominations.


**Uniformity:** All units of the currency are identical in value.

**Limited supply:** The supply of the currency can’t be arbitrarily inflated.

**Acceptability:** The currency must be sufficiently widely accepted.

### Key Characteristics of a Blockchain

- **Decentralized control:** Communal consensus, rather than one party’s decision, dictates who gets to access or update the blockchain.
- **Tamper-evidence:** It’s immediately obvious if data stored on the blockchain has been tampered with.
- **Nakamoto consensus:** One has to provably spend resources when updating the blockchain.
