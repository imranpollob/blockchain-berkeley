## What is Bitcoin?

### Definitions

**Cryptocurrency:** A form of currency that’s stored completely digitally, and isn’t issued by a central authority. Made secure with cryptography, distributed consensus, and economic incentive alignment.
- Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency.

**Blockchain:** The data structure used to represent a cryptocurrency. Stores data in a way that allows multiple parties to access it reliably without having to trust one another.

### Key Characteristics of a Currency

- **Durability:** The currency does not lose value and is not destroyed or made irredeemable easily.
- **Portability:** The currency is easy to transport from place to place.
- **Divisibility:** The currency can be easily exchanged in different denominations.
- **Uniformity:** All units of the currency are identical in value.
- **Limited supply:** The supply of the currency can’t be arbitrarily inflated.
- **Acceptability:** The currency must be sufficiently widely accepted.

### Key Characteristics of a Blockchain

- **Decentralized control:** Communal consensus, rather than one party’s decision, dictates who gets to access or update the blockchain.
- **Tamper-evidence:** It’s immediately obvious if data stored on the blockchain has been tampered with.
- **Nakamoto consensus:** One has to provably spend resources when updating the blockchain.

### What is Centralization?

- Authorization handled by a single party
- Data is stored by a single party
- Think:
    - Client-server networking
    - Hierarchical org chart
    - Political dynasty
    - Central bank
    - Figurehead

### Centralization Pros & Cons

Pros:
- Efficiency: Data is stored in one place, programs are executed once
- Easy updates: Updates need one stamp of approval and can be force-pushed to users

Cons: 
- Lack of sovereignty: A central party may choose to use your data arbitrarily
- One point of failure: Any hack, attack, or failure only has to happen in one place
